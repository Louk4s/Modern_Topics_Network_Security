This folder comprises the theoretical material covered during the first semester of our fourth academic year in the Department of Computer Engineering and Informatics at the University of Patras, Greece. 
As an elective course, the class size was smaller, allowing for a more concentrated and focused curriculum, which contributed to the overall success of the course.
